        <title>Publish Your Public Memex</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I make static sites for most of my websites and thus I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; not only for their free hosting but also because it allows others to submit improvements to my site that I can approve with the click of a single button.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Create Your Own Site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you have decided you need to create your own site. I created one is because it is cheap, easy, and fun. Let&amp;#39;s face it, most of us won&amp;#39;t be famous because of a website we created about our interests but I don&amp;#39;t think that is why most people create a website about themselves. I think &lt;strong&gt;the main reason people create websites is to &lt;a href=&quot;../why-be-findable&quot;&gt;be findable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; In either case creating your own site shouldn&amp;#39;t be overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ownership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by your &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; site? I mean a place where you can post content where you own the domain name. This is important because all the content you post increases the owner&amp;#39;s search rankings. So while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myawesomesite.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;www.myawesomesite.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt; might be &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; to create it definitely isn&amp;#39;t your own site. That&amp;#39;s not to say that you shouldn&amp;#39;t use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, just that you should buy a domain name pointing to where your content is hosted mostly because then you get all the Google juice. You also want to own your domain name so that a business shutting down or censorship (outside of ICANN) doesn&amp;#39;t prevent people from finding you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Domains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domains are about $10-$15 a year and are the cheapest investment in managing your online reputation. The other great thing about owning your own site and consequently your own domain is that you can use that domain for a professional looking email address because domain names in email address do &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5447335/know-what-your-email-address-says-about-you&quot;&gt;communicate something about you&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest way to set that up is through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/&quot;&gt;Google Apps for Work&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com&quot;&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking a domain name is easy if you are considering using your name. Just see if your first and last name or just last name is available with any popular top level domain such as .com, .net, .org, .co etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hosting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting your website can be fairly cheap as well or even free. Though if you go the free route you may have to put up with some ads. When considering where to host your site you will want to consider how hands on you want to be. For most people Tumblr, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; are the way to go and they all you to easily buy and connect a domain name to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;More Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want more control then you can find a host that allows you to upload your site code to their servers and you will have to pay more or less depending on how dynamic you want your website to. I prefer lots of control and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ben.balter.com/2013/09/16/treat-data-as-code/&quot;&gt;treat my data as code&lt;/a&gt; thus my site is an &lt;strong&gt;easily editable, collaborative, testable, simple (not easy), offline friendly, customizable static site&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are curious what that is all about then take the red pill see how you can &lt;a href=&quot;publish-your-public-memex&quot;&gt;publish your public memex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why be Findable?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;#39;s ultra connected world a lot of people talk about not wanting to be found and how the only way to get off the grid is to live in a cave. For others all they want is be found. But for most of us we are looking for mix or rather a way to &lt;strong&gt;manage our reputation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire to be found extends past individuals to companies and organizations as well. And this is shown by all the money spent on trying to be easily findable by advertising on billboards hiring experts to increase one&amp;#39;s ranking in popular search engines. A corollary to this is the desire to not be found or at least to have the good things people think about outrank the negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an entity is found there are a variety of actions they desire users to take including nothing. While that might sound crazy especially if good money is spent on being findable. However I think it is a valid desire if only because being findable at one point in time is an investment for the future of wanting a user to take more action or at least it is according to search engines that rank older sites better than newer sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the reason most individuals spend time and money on being findable is to &lt;strong&gt;demonstrate expertise&lt;/strong&gt; whether that is professional or recreational. The easiest and cheapest way to do that today is by being findable on the Internet. The quickest way to do that is to create a social media account and upload some content. But if you want to own your online reputation then you need to &lt;a href=&quot;computing/create-your-own-site&quot;&gt;create your own site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--- # TODO: create bliki post and link --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog/wiki or bliki. It is currently formatted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, generated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, built by &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/stevemoser/stevemoser.org&quot;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; and hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevemoser/stevemoser.org&quot;&gt;view it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you see room for improvement (even just a typo) please use the edit button above and submit a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Starting Point&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few good starting points for exploring content here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;why-be-findable&quot;&gt;Why be findable?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;bliki-architectre&quot;&gt;Bliki architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Categories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;computing/README&quot;&gt;Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Stubs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be links to posts with little or no content and that is okay. This allows me to write about things as deep or broad as I want to go and come back and flesh out the in-between pages later. Normally this would lead to a mess with a normal blog but hopefully most people don&amp;#39;t consume this site like a normal blog.&lt;/p&gt;
