        <title>Syndicated Memex</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A syndicated Memex is simply a collaborative hypertext based system used as personal knowledge base with published updates in reverse chronological order. Others might call it a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html&quot;&gt;bliki&lt;/a&gt; which Martin Fowler attributes to Ward Cunningham, the father of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex&quot;&gt;Memex&lt;/a&gt; is a better sounding postmanteau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First a bit of history. The first non-analog system I used for storing notes was OneNote back when Windows Tablet PCs were popular. It actually had decent handwriting recognition which was useful when taking notes in engineering classes were diagrams and math equations were the norm. However as my studies moved to Computer Science I started using Linux more since not only was our homework about unix systems but we had to submit our homework on a unix based machine. I briefly used Tomboy and valued the idea of portable plaintext notes before deciding that it wasn&amp;#39;t the year of the Linux desktop and picked up a MacBook. I gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://plausible.coop/voodoopad/&quot;&gt;VoodooPad&lt;/a&gt; a go and it seemed like a great note taking system until I couldn&amp;#39;t stand not having an iPhone app to go with. Next I tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/&quot;&gt;nvAlt&lt;/a&gt; paired with Simplenote which got me started on adding simple markup to my notes in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From then on I marked up all my notes with Markdown and I was interested in linking my notes together and accessing them online. GitHub&amp;#39;s wiki powered by Gollum was a great solution and made me realize how nice it is to have multi-folder support which nvAlt doesn&amp;#39;t have. I considered running multiple instances of nvAlt or even running Gollum locally when I found Github&amp;#39;s support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes/&quot;&gt;Relative links in READMEs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was conflicted because I preferred wiki markup syntax over the regular markup syntax because it represents the semantics of what I want more which is links between documents regardless of if the documents are rendered or not. However there is much wider support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/adding-links-to-wikis/&quot;&gt;regular markup syntax style links&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I could edit and link my notes locally and online the next step was to publish them. A static site generated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; seemed like the way to go not only for their free hosting but also because it allows others to submit improvements to my site that I can approve with the click of a single button. However Jekyll doesn&amp;#39;t support wiki markup syntax and it does a literal conversion of regular markup syntax which means a link to this page which looks like &lt;code&gt;[Syndicated Memex](syndicated-memex)&lt;/code&gt; works fine locally but breaks when rendered on my site because my permalinks don&amp;#39;t end with &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;. I also took issue with Jekyll&amp;#39;s philosophy that posts must have a date in the filename so I set off looking for other static site generators knowing that I would give up GitHub Page&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/&quot;&gt;automatic building of Jekyll based repos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked out a few static site generators and landed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://middlemanapp.com&quot;&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed to do most of what I needed except I ran into few issues with permalinks and general blogging support that Jekyll had in spades. I decided it was easier to modify Jekyll through its plugin system and monkey patching. I still needed to automatically generate the site whenever I pushed a commit to my site repo so I setup Travis CI. Now I can finally edit and publish my portable plaintext notes marked up in Markdown with support for relative links.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Create Your Own Site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you have decided you need to create your own site. I created one is because it is cheap, easy, and fun. Let&amp;#39;s face it, most of us won&amp;#39;t be famous because of a website we created about our interests but I don&amp;#39;t think that is why most people create a website about themselves. I think &lt;strong&gt;the main reason people create websites is to &lt;a href=&quot;../sociology/why-be-findable&quot;&gt;be findable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; In either case creating your own site shouldn&amp;#39;t be overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ownership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by your &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; site? I mean a place where you can post content where you own the domain name. This is important because all the content you post increases the owner&amp;#39;s search rankings. So while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myawesomesite.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;www.myawesomesite.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt; might be &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; to create it definitely isn&amp;#39;t your own site. That&amp;#39;s not to say that you shouldn&amp;#39;t use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, just that you should buy a domain name pointing to where your content is hosted mostly because then you get all the Google juice. You also want to own your domain name so that a business shutting down or censorship (outside of ICANN) doesn&amp;#39;t prevent people from finding you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Domains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domains are about $10-$15 a year and are the cheapest investment in managing your online reputation. The other great thing about owning your own site and consequently your own domain is that you can use that domain for a professional looking email address because domain names in email address do &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/5447335/know-what-your-email-address-says-about-you&quot;&gt;communicate something about you&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest way to set that up is through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/&quot;&gt;Google Apps for Work&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com&quot;&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking a domain name is easy if you are considering using your name. Just see if your first and last name or just last name is available with any popular top level domain such as .com, .net, .org, .co etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hosting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting your website can be fairly cheap as well or even free. Though if you go the free route you may have to put up with some ads. When considering where to host your site you will want to consider how hands on you want to be. For most people Tumblr, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squarespace.com&quot;&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt; are the way to go and they all you to easily buy and connect a domain name to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;More Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want more control then you can find a host that allows you to upload your site code to their servers and you will have to pay more or less depending on how dynamic you want your website to. I prefer lots of control and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ben.balter.com/2013/09/16/treat-data-as-code/&quot;&gt;treat my data as code&lt;/a&gt; thus my site is an &lt;strong&gt;easily editable, collaborative, testable, simple (not easy), offline friendly, customizable static site&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are curious what that is all about then take the red pill see how you can create your own &lt;a href=&quot;syndicated-memex&quot;&gt;syndicated memex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why be Findable?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;#39;s ultra connected world a lot of people talk about not wanting to be found and how the only way to get off the grid is to live in a cave. For others all they want is be found. But for most of us we are looking for mix or rather a way to &lt;strong&gt;manage our reputation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire to be found extends past individuals to companies and organizations as well. And this is shown by all the money spent on trying to be easily findable by advertising on billboards hiring experts to increase one&amp;#39;s ranking in popular search engines. A corollary to this is the desire to not be found or at least to have the good things people think about outrank the negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an entity is found there are a variety of actions they desire users to take including nothing. While that might sound crazy especially if good money is spent on being findable. However I think it is a valid desire if only because being findable at one point in time is an investment for the future of wanting a user to take more action or at least it is according to search engines that rank older sites better than newer sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the reason most individuals spend time and money on being findable is to &lt;strong&gt;demonstrate expertise&lt;/strong&gt; whether that is professional or recreational. The easiest and cheapest way to do that today is by being findable on the Internet. The quickest way to do that is to create a social media account and upload some content. But if you want to own your online reputation then you need to &lt;a href=&quot;../computing/create-your-own-site&quot;&gt;create your own site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/stevemoser/stevemoser.org.svg?branch=master&quot; alt=&quot;travis ci badge&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog/wiki/bliki/memex. It is currently formatted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, generated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, built by &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/stevemoser/stevemoser.org&quot;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; and hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevemoser/stevemoser.org&quot;&gt;view it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. If you see room for improvement (even just a typo) please use the edit button above and submit a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Starting Point&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few good starting points for exploring content here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;sociology/why-be-findable&quot;&gt;Why be findable?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;syndicated-memex&quot;&gt;Syndicated Memex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Categories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;apple-dev/README&quot;&gt;Apple Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;computing/README&quot;&gt;Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;sociology/README&quot;&gt;Sociology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;programming/README&quot;&gt;Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Stubs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be links to posts with little or no content and that is okay. This allows me to write about things as deep or broad as I want to go and come back and flesh out the in-between pages later. Normally this would lead to a mess with a normal blog but hopefully most people don&amp;#39;t consume this site like a normal blog.&lt;/p&gt;
