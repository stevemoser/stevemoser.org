Welcome to my blog/wiki/bliki/memex. It is currently formatted in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), built by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/stevemoser/stevemoser.org) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). You can also [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/stevemoser/stevemoser.org). If you see room for improvement (even just a typo) please use the edit button above and submit a pull request.

#### Starting Point

Here are a few good starting points for exploring content here:

 - [Why be findable?](sociology/why-be-findable.md)
 - [Syndicated Memex](syndicated-memex.md)

#### Categories

- [Apple Development](apple-dev/README.md)
- [Computing](computing/README.md)
- [Sociology](sociology/README.md)
- [Programming](programming/README.md)

#### Stubs

There may be links to posts with little or no content and that is okay. This allows me to write about things as deep or broad as I want to go and come back and flesh out the in-between pages later. Normally this would lead to a mess with a normal blog but hopefully most people don't consume this site like a normal blog.
